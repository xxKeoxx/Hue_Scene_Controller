# Hue Scene Controller
Hue App and driver for Hubitat automation hub.<br>
I developed this app and driver to allow me to pass zone name and scene name into webcore.<br>
Webcore then runs the Set Hue Scene command passing the zone name, scene name, and on/off to the decice.<br>
This allows me to control any scene I want without needing to add a switch device for each scene.<br>
<br>

The app requires a Hue Api Key and the ip address of your Hue Bridge<br>
once you fill the information in the device for this app will be created.<br>

The Device command "Set Hue Scene" requires 3 parameters as shown in the screne capture<br>
The on and off buttons dont do anything at this time.<br>
